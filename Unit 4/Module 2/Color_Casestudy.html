    <h1>About this project</h1>
    <p>"Visual sense of order and clarity of purpose" -- I achieved this by making the background blue, which is symbolic of both order and clarity.</p>
    <p>"Appreciate nature and being made by hand" --- The lime-green shows an appreciation of nature and being made by hand, as greens are symbolic of nature.</p>
    <p>"Smells like flowers and citrus and cinnamon" --- I imagine citrus as a lemon and lime color, hence the reason why I included both on this page. Could not incorporate flowers or cinnamon without breaking the resulting color scheme.</p>
    <p>"Eclectic mix of world music" --- The colors chosen are a mix and are not a single color or several close colors.</p>
    <p>"I am a kinda blue and purple fan" --- Blue and purple are both colors I chose for this page.</p>
    <p>The color scheme that resulted is two pairs of complementary colors, lime and purple, and orange and blue.</p>
